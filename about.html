The SME is a skills training initiative founded by Precious Radebe.<br> Inspired by her elderly relatives who didn't have the chance to upskill or pursue formal education, Precious established this school to support and empower members of her community.

We provide essential skills training for domestic workers and gardeners. Our mission is to make them more marketable to employers, enabling them to secure higher wages due to their expanded skillset. Beyond employment, this training also empowers individuals to become entrepreneurs and launch their own small businesses. Ultimately, we aim to help employers provide more skilled services to their households while building brighter futures for our trainees.</p>
